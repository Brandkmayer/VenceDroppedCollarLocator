# VenceDroppedCollarLocator
This script can be used to assist in locating dropped collars when using the Vence_API dataframe output. Data requested directly from Vence should work as well. This file is placed into a folder named "CollarData". 
Collars that are suspected to be a dropped should be relocated into a seperate virtual herd and collar list exported.  This file is placed into a folder named "TargetCollars". 
Script will recognize the most recently modified files in both folders. 

File can be sourced and produces a shapefile and a KML file into the "Product" folder of the collar's averaged location from one month of data.
